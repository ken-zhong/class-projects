## Towers of Hanoi - JavaScript / jQuery ##

A simple Towers of Hanoi game. Uses jQuery and OOP with the ES6 class constructors.

The discs were easily created using the flex display 'column-reverse' property, allowing us to treat the HTML elements effectively as objects that we can easily manipulate.
